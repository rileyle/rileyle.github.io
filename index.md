### Fall 2025 Courses
- [PHYS-201: *Classical Mechanics*](https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/19886)
- [PHYS-339W: *Advanced Physics Laboratory II*](https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/19151)

### Spring and Summer 2025
Ewan Chattin (UC Physics '25), Maddy Hickson (UC Physics '26), and Nathaniel Nerone (UC Pre-Engineering '27) tested and measured full energy detection efficiencies, energy resolutions, and timing resolutions of 9 CeBr<SUB>3</SUB> scintillator detectors purchased with [National Science Foundation support](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2405485). These detectors will become part of the CeBrA array of gamma-ray detectors at the [Fox Lab at Florida State University](http://fsunuc.physics.fsu.edu/research/fox_lab/), which is used with the Super Enge Split Pole Spectrograph to collect charged-particle gamma-ray coincidence data from nuclear reactions. 

### Spring and Summer 2024
Alyssa Himmelreich (UC Physics '26) and Blake McNulty (UC Pre-Engineering '26) traveled to the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University to complete inverse-kinematics proton scattering measurements of the <I>N=28</I> isotones <SUP>44</SUP>S and <SUP>42</SUP>Si. The combined results of the Coulomb excitation and proton scattering measurements of <SUP>42</SUP>Si will shed light on the relative contributions of neutrons and protons to the collective excitation of this nucleus.

Ewan Chattin (UC Pre-Engineering '25) spent 5 weeks at the [Fox Lab at Florida State University](http://fsunuc.physics.fsu.edu/research/fox_lab/) studying the neutron shell structure of <SUP>62</SUP>Ni via the <SUP>61</SUP>Ni + d &rarr; <SUP>62</SUP>Ni + p neutron transfer reaction using the Super Enge Split Pole Spectrograph with the CeBrA demonstrator array.
