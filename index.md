### Spring and Summer 2025 Research
Ewan Chattin (UC Physics '25), Maddy Hickson (UC Physics '26), and Nathaniel Nerone (UC Pre-Engineering '27) tested and measured full energy detection efficiencies, energy resolutions, and timing resolutions of 9 CeBr<SUB>3</SUB> scintillator detectors purchased with [National Science Foundation support](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2405485). These detectors will become part of the CeBrA array of gamma-ray detectors at the [Fox Lab at Florida State University](http://fsunuc.physics.fsu.edu/research/fox_lab/), which is used with the Super Enge Split Pole Spectrograph to collect charged-particle gamma-ray coincidence data from nuclear reactions.
